# SMRT-Godot

**SMRT-Godot**: System for Multi Rethorical Texts for Godot is a dialog system with a fancy name.
It is a port of a dialog system I made in Construct2.
This is the very first system I created for my game in Godot, so it shows in the code, still I thought it was worth sharing it.

I'd really love to see any project or use that you made out of this awfully-coded piece, so don't hesitate to drop me a line or send me a link of your work.

## What is SMRT-Godot?

[![See it in action](https://img.youtube.com/vi/msL8dBuSBm0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msL8dBuSBm0)


SMRT-Godot is a dialog system + editor created for my needs while making a game. It gives a new approach to multi-language support for the game/project, by using simple JSON for storing information that is interpreted by the dialog system.

It is also ~~most likely~~ responsive and resolution independent.

## Installing

**Needs Godot 2.1 or newer**

[Godot's Website]
(http://www.godotengine.com)

On your project's root, create an "addons" folder

Copy the contents of `/addons` to your project's `/addons` folder

Open your project in Godot, go to `Project Settings`, click on the `Plugins` tab and enable SMRT

## How does it work?
